Visualize the Asteroid Skies

## overview
Astroact simulates the position of planets and 1,572 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) and predict their possible near pass with earth in the future. Astroact provides interactive three dimensional visualization of the solar system with head tracking which helps to understand its actual geometry.
